this should not be distributed with the package, development notes.


to-do list:

(1)I misunderstood the making-packages documentation related to math in .Rd
files.  See the manual for the original logcondens package.  All the math
works there, so no \eqn{} is needed apparently.  My documentation should just
be modified to be like the original.

(2)Need to grab the source documentation from the website for the functions of
logcondens that I modify and add my modifications.

(3) !!! Error in the CI-forming code when original data has weights.  
 (i) the LRmodeTest is under development as LRmodeTest.weights, same for
 LCLRCImode.  There is one call in LCLRCImode.weights to LRmodeTest.weights, which needs to be changed to a call to LRmodeTest, once the names are changed.
 (ii) in LRmodeTest.weights, we refer to LCTLLRdistn using ":::".  need to remove that, once 
   the function is part of the pcakage and has access to the namespace again.
